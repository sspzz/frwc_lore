# Druid Eyolf of Arcadia

# Prologue

> _Life in nature has often been said to be red in both tooth and claw. This common belief then, as imagined from the comfort of a warm cot, or settled peacefully by a fire would, ever eager for absolutes, paint the world in stark hues, rendered in black and white; All that which is unordered and entropic, the intangibles neither shackled nor controlled, would - without the barest hesitation – thus see you bleeding, mauled, become prey._
> 
> _Probably not far from the truth, all things considered. The flawed nature of this most favoured sentiment becomes apparent, blurring truth, distorting reality, when the honesty of brutality is equated to the hateful touch of wickedness. Was the mountain lion, searching for sustenance for the season’s litter, somehow evil for relentless pursuits of the startled buck? And what of the tree, ruthlessly stealing the warm sun’s rays from the struggling bush below?_
> 
> _No, surely the Wild is not inherently wicked. Man, however, with cruel intent and selfish convictions, insatiable and indomitable, cannot so easily be absolved._
>

> The Dangers of Duplicity

He dreamed of the pack. Loping alongside his litter, playfully snapping at each other’s flanks, working off some of the left-over energy from the hunt. Finally, driving the proud prey to the ground exhausted and spent, they had basked in the glory of the feast of the felled buck. As always, the strong had fed first, however the meat was plentiful and shared among them with nary a disagreement, as much for the esteem they held for one another as the intrinsic knowledge that the pack was only as strong as its weakest cub.

_Crunch._

The impact took his breath away, as he was rudely roused from his slumber, for a moment bewildered and expecting the next blow. Catching him unawares, even in sleep, was no easy feat and scrambling to his feet, back to the low firepit he had dug earlier, Druid Eyolf – possibly one of the last remaining Wolfkin – scanned his surrounding with eyes that had no trouble piecing the dark forest.

But the night was quiet, his exceptional hearing catching naught to cause alarm - the breeze, the buzz of miniscule insects, leaves rustling and the occasional small prey, scrambling for cover – nor could his eyes discern any threat. Gingerly probing the back of his head, expecting to find blood or swelling, he found merely his silky fur, no pain, no damage. _Perhaps but a dream then_, he thought, relaxing his grip on his Big Magic Stick and sitting back down slowly in front of the dying embers of the fire.

_Flee!_
 
The impression exploded in his head, vivid as it was chaotic. His vision swimming, heart hammering, he felt frantic breaths come fast - too fast - frothy with blood and sputum, and there was something wrong with his left eye. Scrambling for purchase on the forest floor, his familiar rabbit fled for its life from an unseen foe.

Slamming back into his own mind, Eyolf set off at a run, his magic flaring to life, Steel rune boldening and strengthening him stride by stride, his stave thrumming with wild magic.

Being a Druid had its advantages, and as he ran, he extended his magic enhanced senses outwards – his will permeating the earth, sinking deep and, saturating the vast network of roots below, he quested outwards in search of his familiar and his veiled assailant. Trees had awareness, as all living things did, however their perspective and perception of time was entirely alien. Thankfully Eyolf had a lifetime of experience, and in mere moments he picked up an unfamiliar presence, an unnatural scent, and increased his pace. 

Bursting into a clearing, magic at his fingertips, he barely had time to register his familiar’s still form next to a floating crystalline structure dead ahead, before a shadowy form struck at him from behind, pain flaring in his back, sending him tumbling forward. The crystal suddenly flared to life, bursting into flame, and Eyolf, unable to stop himself caught a last fleeting glimpse of moving shadows all around, before falling headfirst into the conflagration.

_Hooooooowl._
