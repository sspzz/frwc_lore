# Archmagus Ixar of the Mount

> The pen is mightier than the sword_, or so it has been said._
> 
> _One could argue however, that such points of view, justified as they may well be, also come from a certain position of entitlement and good fortune. For surely those who have been unfortunate enough to find themselves on the pointy end of the sword, and I hope you will pardon the pun, may find it hard to reconcile such conjecture._
> 
> _In the grand scheme of things, on matters on a larger scale and of deeper import, I would tend to agree with the former; it is in the stories, in the education and in the lore that we may transcend and ascend, become more, grow as a speies - whereas the sword, well it may serve to dominate and defend, surely cannot create, only destroy._
> 
> _And yet therein lies the crux, for to be bestowed the privilege to not only read, learn and grow, but to also wield such potent power that the pen represents, one may very well also depend on those who are willing to wield the sword. For the enemies of truth are many, and only behind safety can one truly express freely._
> 
> _So wield thy pen not lightly, should you interestes lie in changing the world. Be thankful to the sacrificial sword that thou so permits, and I shall hope your intentions are for the better and not for worse._
