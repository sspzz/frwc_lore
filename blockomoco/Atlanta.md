# Magus Atlanta of the Hills

## A Tale of Twin Serpents II

There was once a tale of twice a Child  
Of sisters Bolde as Blood  
Both were Fair as they were Wilde  
Yet one was Loved and one Reviled  
Whence sprang from separate Bud  

And though the two looked Quite the same  
One was Envious, Atlanta was her name  
And where she went, so slithered her Snake  
And Oh! How hearts of Men did Break  

For such was her Malisciousness  
Well hid beneath Deceit  
That none could help but fall for her  
Infatutation fore long complete  

Atwined her fragrant Fungus  
Her Sanguine serpent would caress  
So, Spirits would Mysteriously  
In her wake Acquiesce  

Concealed in Pouch, the swiftest Knife  
The beating Heart, once strong and fast  
Now inexorably void of Life
