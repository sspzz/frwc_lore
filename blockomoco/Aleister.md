# Aleister of the Palms

> _[..] and so we remember those brave souls who, despite the dangers of draught and horrors of haunted thoughts, have ventured into those sands - in search of that most elusive Hermit, the one they call Fairwinds. Does he exist truly, or simply in the minds of the despondent who cling to the hope beyond hope, that there - hidden deep withing the sands - lies their recompense, a hope for lost minds, indeed their absolution?_
> 
> _If any have actually succeeded in finding that which they seek, there deep amongst the uncountable and unyielding grains of sand, I am unaware. Have they all perished then? Or have some scant few, through pure dumb luck, divine desitny or perhaps singular skill, traversed the unforgiving landscape and found not their ruin, but instead become blessed by the sweet cooling winds conjured by Aleister himself?_
> 
> _One can only imagine how chapped lips, and indeed how parched throat would then succumb or be saved, and envision stinging eyes and burning skin thus soothed either in delirium or - should it exist - blessed relief as they collapse at their final destination. I wonder if they would even know the difference, nor have I ever heard the tale of any such soul returning from that infinite sea of sand._
> 
> _Nay, I shall not seek out such adventures, for I am nor desperate nor inclined to such self-flaggelation, though I must confess a sense of jeslousy and grudgning respect for those foolish, or forlorn enough, to brave such a journey._
