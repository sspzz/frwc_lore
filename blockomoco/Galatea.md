# Magus Galatea of the Heath

## A Tale of Twin Serpents I

There was once a tale of twice a Child  
Of sisters Bolde as Blood  
Both were Fair as they were Wilde  
Yet one was Loved and one Reviled  
Whence sprang from separate Bud  

And though the two looked Quite the same  
One was Hamonious, Galatea her name  
And where she went, so slithered her Snake  
And Oh! How hearts of Men did Break  

For such was her Aesthetic  
So beautiful to Beholde  
That none dared look askance or stray  
Nor man, nor lass, nor young or olde  

Atwined her staff of Harmony  
Her Verdant serpent would caress  
So, Spirits would Mysteriously  
In her wake soon Quiesce  

Atwixt her hair, the flowers brightly Bloomed  
The scented Air, once dull and stale  
Now intoxicatingly perfumed
