# Garfield the Exemplary

> While not arcane in nature, it has been said that the bond between master and steed is not all that different to that of Familiar and Wizard.
>  
> Indeed, a mount well cared for - groomed, loved and respected like family - would not merely be an exemplary beast of burden, but could be prone to great sacrifice on behalf of their master.
> 
> It is not unheard of that such a horse would be driven to dive head first through fire, mane aflame and eyes ablaze - facing equine terrors unimaginable - on behalf of those they have learned to love.

The ropes chafed his neck. 

And the scents and sounds were still all wrong.

The moon was the same, the giant eye in the night sky granting a semblance of normalcy, but the land was unfamiliar and Garfield felt utterly alone.

Ever since that terrifying night of fire and stifling smoke, of chaos and confusion, he had not seen or smelled Master. Kind Master, fair Master. 

In frustration he stomped his hooves, snorted and pulled at his ropes again. Only to receive another rock thrown at his flank, unkind words wielded like a wicked lash, followed by bouts of laughter. 

Master has a nice laugh, but this laugher was not the good kind.

The night breeze changed directions and suddenly his mane shivered and both ears perked up. Breathing deep, Garfield was sure; Master was near.
