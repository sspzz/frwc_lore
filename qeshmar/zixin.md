# Night Ghoul Zixin of the Ice Abyss

Cold. Dark. Oh so cuttingly cold and deviously dark. 

Such a strange sensation perhaps, that passion would derive from these things, yet lust and joy caroused through his necrotic veins all the same; The delightful juxaposition of his existence sustained him now, beyond the gates of Death.

Zixin remembered little of life except perhaps a few flickers of warmth and light, and a fortunate thing too for here far into the Ice Abyss, nestled deep in the Night, such thoughts reviled him to his very core. No, far better this enchanting embrace of air near frozen solid, this dark potential more ancient than perhaps Night herself.

Fondly cradling his Hourglass, its glass rimmed with fanciful frost, he watched the sand lazily rise up, up, up; Peculiar how it never completely emptied nor filled, yet had somehow found an equilibrium - an inverse of balance.

_Ah, the lovely hubris of Chronomancy,_ he reflected merrily as he once again went through the plans in his head. 

_Cronos, for all his power and abilities, won't see me coming **this** time._
